JGEX can import certain GeoGebra files with the following limitations:

Allowed GeoGebra objects:
points, segments, lines, circles.

Supported commands:
Polygon, Midpoint, Segment, Line, OrthogonalLine, LineBisector, Intersect, Circle.

Support for intersection of a line and a circle or two circles is incomplete.

Not supported at the moment (among other objects):
Parallel lines, angle bisectors.
These need to be constructed via simple Euclidean steps (see above).

Colors and other properties of the objects are ignored.

The Prove command is partially supported.
The following syntaxes are currently recognized:
* Prove(AreCollinear(A, B, C))
* Prove(AreConcyclic(A, B, C, D))
* Prove(AreParallel(f, g)) or Prove(f ∥ g)
* Prove(f ≟ g)
* Prove(P ∈ l)
* Prove(f ⊥ g)
